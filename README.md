# Todo Appüìù 
 # 1.  Functionality and Features
This To-do application will offer the following functionalities:< br / >

**1. Adding New Tasks:** Users can create new tasks by entering a description in an input field and submitting it.< br / >
**2. Viewing Tasks:** A list will display all existing tasks retrieved from the database.< br / >
**3. Editing Tasks:** Users can edit the description of existing tasks to modify their content.< br / >
**4. Deleting Tasks:** Users can remove unwanted tasks from the list.< br / >

# 2. Tech Stack 
We'll be utilising the MERN Stack for building this application:< br / >

**MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that efficiently stores our task data, including completion status and potentially edit timestamps (for future reference).< br / >
**Express.js:** A web framework built on Node.js that simplifies building the server-side logic for handling user requests (adding, marking complete, editing, deleting tasks), as well as interacting with the MongoDB database.< br / >
**React.js:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface. We'll use React to create an interactive frontend that allows users to add, view, mark complete, edit, and delete tasks. < br / >
**Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run our server-side code written in JavaScript (with Express.js) on the server. < br / >
